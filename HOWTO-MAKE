======================================
MAKE Handhelds-USB driver for Mac OS X
======================================

0. About
--------

This is an experimental driver (or technically speaking a "kernel extension")
that allows Mac OS X to communicate with a Sharp Zaurus or other Handheld Devices
over USB.

1. How to compile
-----------------

- Select "Compile" as the Active Target.
- press Build - this will open a Terminal window.
- Type 'make' in that Terminal.
- You will be asked for the root password since AJZaurusUSB must be compiled as root.

NOTE: for testing if the code compiles, you can select the AJZaurusUSB target and simply Build.
But it will fail with a 'permission denied' error when trying to create the package.

2. Testing
----------

For testing source code modifications, DON'T install the driver since it
will confuse the kext loader and sometimes you will load the old one.

If you already have, delete the folder "AJZaurusUSB.kext" located at
"/System/Library/Extensions" and reboot.

Or type

  make uninstall

and reboot!

To test a freshly built version, connect the USB device to your Mac and
turn it on. Then type

  make load

inside a terminal window to load the driver. Switching on the USB device
should now initialize the driver.

After you're finished, type

  make unload

and afterwards turn off or disconnect the device. To see what's going on,
you should have an open console window during testing or a terminal window
executing "tail -f /var/log/system.log".


3. Creating an installer package
--------------------------------

Type

  make pkg
  
This will first build the driver and then load the file "AJZaurusUSB.pmproj"
with the Package Maker application (included in Apple's developer tools).
1. Go to the "Package Version" tab and edit the version number
2. Choose "Build..." from the "Project" menu to create the installer package
and save as "AJZaurusUSB.pkg" in the working directory.

Note that it will complain a little about a missing file "AJZaurusUSB.jpg".
This is the background image of the installer which is not included in the
source code since it has a different license.

Finally type
  
  make tgz

to make a distribution package that contains everything.

4. Debugging
--------------------------------

You need two Macintosh computers connected by an Ethernet cable. Both must
have the same Mac OS X release version, but you can mix Intel and PowerPC.

Make sure the Ethernet works and is the only connection (i.e. no WLAN!).
Identify the ZeroConf name of the debug machine and write that into the makefile
(TARGET) on the developer machine. Enable Remote Login (ssh) on the debug machine.

Then to enable kernel debugging and switch a multi-core machine to use 1 CPU only,

  make enable-kdb

To start a debugging session,

  make gdb
